          I’m basically a passionate nerd dev tech lead with almost 20 years of
          experience in web & mobile development. In the latest years of my
          career path I’ve moved most of my time from full coding to dev team(s)
          management and I deeply believe that most of the people are able to
          become very valuable for the company and help it to gain market if
          they are put in the correct environment and mindset.

          <h3><span>Engineering Manager</span> / Casavo, Milano</h3>
          <p>
            As Engineering Manager in the Commercialization (ex Brokers) team in
            Casavo I was responsible to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Have 1:1 meetings, growth conversations and people management
              activities with the developers
            </li>
            <li>Defining working agreements & guidelines</li>
            <li>
              Having weelky meetings with the PM to define activities and
              roadmap
            </li>
            <li>Checking PRs and minor coding activities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            During my time in Casavo I have also been “Community of Practice
            leader” for the Frontend CoP for 1+ year, in which I’ve coordinated
            various cross-team initiatives spanning from the creation of shared
            knowledge base to defining shared components and utilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest challenge in Casavo has been the scale down of the
            company, moving from a quite large tech department organized in
            domain “tribes” to a more lightweight and streamlined situation with
            3 tech teams, thus removing and reorganizing different layers of
            abstractions and complexity.

          <p>
            Developing and fixing mostly Vue.js and Nuxt applications. I also
            had the opportunity to work from scratch of the refactor of a
            Node.js service. As side activities I’m a maintainer of an internal
            UI components library and wrote documentation/induction guides for
            new teammates.

          <p>
            Returned to Mohole as a limited-time contractor to work on some
            internal management tools we built using React and Laravel as
            development frameworks and Github for repos, project management and
            CI/CD. As a minor task I’ve also teached most of the basics of
            frontend development for the whole academic year to two distinct
            classese of young students.

          <p>
            In UTU, a fintech startup based in Singapore, my role in the company
            is to lead the development teams of the mobile and web solutions.
            Back then we had one consumer app, another one for partners, one
            WeChat mini-program and various management backoffices used by
            Customer Care and internal staff. I’ve been also responsible for the
            migration from the first POC hybrid app to the current in production
            and fully native ones.

          <p>
            Bitrock is a consultancy company that gave me the task to create and
            maintain new department within the company responsible to deliver UI
            centered solution (Web, Mobile Native and some smaller embedded
            solutions) to different clients mostly focused around the
            Financial/Fintech landscape. I’ve setted up process, tech stacks,
            mentored newcomers, interviewed most of the candidates and wrote
            some shared libraries. Due to the company strong involvement in
            Scala & Kafka technologies, I’ve became quite used to concepts like
            Event Driven and SCS architectures.

          <p>
            During my time in Contactlab I’ve transitioned from being the only
            frontend developer to becoming the tech lead for a newly created
            frontend dev team, defining both tech decisions (Web Components,
            React, SCSS, Webpack) and team processes. I’ve also been a
            (learning) Scrum Master for one of the products team, and started
            interviewing new candidates for my team.

            I’ve joined Mohole in their early stages as a startup (6-7 people,
            myself included), and as Teacher I’ve defined and taught many of the
            (still running) web design and development related courses. And as
            frontend developer I’ve developed the main website and some internal
            management tools using HTML, CSS, jQuery, WordPress and some PHP.

            (v1).
