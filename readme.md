# Dockerfile for salvatorelaisa.me 

This is a slight customization (*adding my domain name in the configuration script*) of the main Dockerfile for the [official Ghost Docker image](https://github.com/docker-library/ghost), but it's pretty useful for deploying [Ghost 1.x](https://ghost.org/) instances on [Now](https://zeit.co/now).
