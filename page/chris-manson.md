[Chris Manson](https://twitter.com/real_ate) is a Ember enthusiast and a member of the [Ember Core Learning Team](https://emberjs.com/team). Ember-Ghost was an experimental project that came out of the work on converting the [Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com) to be a static Ember application. Ember-Ghost has since inspired the creation of [Guidemaker](https://github.com/empress/guidemaker) and is a driving force for the evolution of the Ember static site ecosystem.

Ember Ghost is entirely open source so if you want to see how it works or if you would like to contribute please [check out the git repository](https://github.com/empress/ember-ghost).
